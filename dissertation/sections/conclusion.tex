This project started out with a comprehensive reviewed a large range of robotics middleware, which was novel and useful because x. This also included a full description of ROS.

The next phase of the project looked into what factors had an impact on high frequency communication in ROS. After analysing many different possible factors shown in Section \ref{}, it was found the processing power and connection type were the largest factors.

Finally, research was done into how ROS scales vertically and horizontally. This includes 


\section{Reflection}

About you. What did you learn. Why are you a better person. How did your skills improve. 

Throughout the project many critical lessons were learned. Firstly, I realised how critical it is to spend time planning and defining a process of which to conduct research. Additionally, I unearthed how critical it is to create detailed experimental criteria and processes.
