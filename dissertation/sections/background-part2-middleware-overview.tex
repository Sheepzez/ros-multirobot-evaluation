\subsection{An Overview Of Robotic Middleware}
\label{overview-of-robotic-middleware}

There is a wide variety of robotic middlewares in use currently. Many employ a free (libre) approach to software by making the source code available online, whereas others are created for commercial licensing using propriatary source. This overview predominantely covers open source middlewares, as there is a greater amount of information available on the design and implementation of these projects. Several of the covered middlewares have fallen out of use and/or development, and this has been noted where applicable. A discussion of the major aspects of the covered middlewares is presented after the table. \textit{Note that several more middlewares were reviewed than are presented in this table, the other middlewares are presented in Appendix \ref{middlewares-overview-appendix}.}

				\item Recreate ROS using existing new tech (such as Redis, WebSockets, DDS)
				\item Overhaul of API (create consistent API without the 7+ years of backward compatibility that ROS1 has)
			\end{itemize} %
