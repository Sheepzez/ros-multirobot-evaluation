\title{Evaluating the Scalability of ROS in Multi-Robot Systems}
\author{Isaac Jordan}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Autonomous robots are being created in an increasingly modular way. This is leading to the creation of many types of robot middleware software frameworks, however much of the existing knowledge about the performance of these middlewares is informal and annecdotal. A single system comprising multiple individual autonomous reobots forms a multi-robot system. These systems have added complexity over single robot systems as inter-robot communication can be orders of magnitude slower than intra-robot communication.

This paper presents an overview of existing robot middlewares, before focussing on the ROS (Robot Operating System) middleware. An evaluation of the limitations of vertical communication scalability and high frequency message tranmission performance is conducted. Important factors affecting high frequency message transmission were found to be the processing power of the host machine - at high message frequencies a 50\% reduction in CPU clock speed doubled the message latencies - and the network medium used: switching to Wi-Fi from Ethernet caused an order-of-magnitude decrease in the maximum supported message frequency. A Communication Scaling Limit Volume (CSLV) formula is proposed as a mechanism to predict whether a particular combination of node count, message frequency, and message size is feasible for a particular vertically scaled system. A series of experiments were conducted which appeared to establish the CSLV hypothesis as a valid means to predict performance for ROS nodes, by showing the predictions were accurate at previously untested message frequencies. Furthermore, a method for a horizontal scaling experiment is proposed.

\chapter{Factors Affecting High Frequency Message Transmission}
\label{communication-chapter}

Multi-robot systems are types of distributed systems. The main concern in moving from a single-host distributed system to a multi-host distributed system is the introduction of more complex communication network. As the overall system is trying to complete a task, the individual nodes in the network must communicate in order to share things like the status of the node (CPU load, disk usage, etc), progress through the current task, and results of a task. The exact nature and direction of this communication is dependent on the architecture of the distributed system.

In ROS, the Master node monitors the progress and status of the other nodes, but does not involve itself in the application logic of the system, meaning that it does not process or handle the results of nodes. This is handled in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion dictated by the application developer - each node is responsible for choosing what information to request from other nodes, and what information to emit from itself using the Publisher/Subscriber model described in Section \ref{background-ros}. The consequence of this architecture is that overall system performance can be dramatically affected by the communication performance between nodes.

In order to systematically evaluate how ROS' communication scales, one must first aim to understand which aspects of the system that are of greatest importance to performance - both in terms of latency of messages, and total throughput of communication. Section \ref{communication-scoping-experiments} aims to analyse the performance bottlenecks of a simple multi-robot system when sending very controlled and artificial data. Section \ref{communication-real-data} will then aim to validate the results of Section \ref{communication-scoping-experiments} using realistic (previously recorded) data streams, with the goal that these conclusions will then be directly applicable to real ROS multi-robot systems. This chapter aims to provide an understanding of the fundamental communication performance characteristics of a multi-robot ROS system, so that vertical and horizontal scaling experiments can be contextualised.

\section{Scoping Experiments}
\label{communication-scoping-experiments}

In order to acquire a detailed understanding of the performance characteristics of ROS' communication channels, a sequence of scoping experiments was designed. The experiments begin very simply - trying to gain baseline expectations of how well ROS will perform, and where problems may occur. Further experiments then investigate individual experimental parameters to identify problem areas for ROS. These experiments were performed using highly controlled data - specifically a single string consisting of `Hello World'. This allows for rapid development and iteration of experiments, while keep the data sent constant. Later experiments (in Section \ref{communication-real-data}) then explore how varying the data sent affects the conclusions of the scoping experiments.

\section{Representative Data Experiments}
\label{communication-real-data}

Previous experiments (in Section \ref{communication-scoping-experiments}) were presented as scoping experiments. These were designed to systematically evaluate and gain understanding of which variables were of concern when running tests on ROS' communication performance. However, it was not certain that these prior conclusions would translate well to using ROS in a realistic scenario since throughout the scoping experiments, the same message of `hello world' was used as dummy data. This is a very small message payload of only 11 bytes.

In order to verify the conclusions were correct, samples of realistic data were explored. Two data types were settled on, `sensor data' and `video data'. Sensor data is the type of data likely the come from a physical sensor on the robot. This data is characterised by small message sizes, such as 4KB. Video data is the type of data recorded from a video camera peripheral, such as a webcam. This type of data generally has larger message sizes in range of hundreds of kilobytes, up to several megabytes per message depending on the resolution and bitrate of the camera.

The exact data sets used in the coming experiments were acquired from the MIT Stata Center dataset \cite{mit-stata-center-dataset}. The dataset is described as follows by the producers of the data: ``The MIT Stata Center Data Set is a vast scale data set collected over a multi-year period in a 10 storey academic building. It contains sensor data collected since January 2011. As of September 2012 the data set comprises over 2.3TB, 38 hours and 42 kilometres (the length of a marathon).''\cite{mit-stata-center-dataset} The data is recorded from sensors on the PR2 (a two-armed wheeled robot), which was one of the first robots to ever be designed using ROS as a middleware. The exact values of the data are not important for this evaluation of ROS, it is only the size and frequency of the messages that are important as there is no analysis or computation being executed on the data being transmitted.

This dataset contains both sensor feeds (from a laser sensor), and video feeds (from a Kinect RGB + depth camera). The sensor data was a 20Hz message stream, which was measured to use 85kB/s of bandwidth, giving an individual message size of 4.25kB. The video data used was a 30Hz (30 frames-per-second) RGB (colour) video stream, with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. This message stream was measured to use 9.25MB/s of bandwidth, implying a message size of 308KB. These data sets are very large (20 - 50GB) which would require modification to the test system (Raspberry Pi 3’s). Thus these datasets have been filtered down to 60 seconds of recording, resulting in 1791 camera images, and 1194 LaserScan readings. This number of messages was chosen at it would give a good number of messages to average latency over (over 1000 for each data type), but would also easily fit on to the SD-card storage of the Raspberry Pis, which is only 8GB in size. The total size of the 60 seconds of data was approximately 1GB.

\chapter{Scalability with ROS}
\label{host-scalability-chapter}

Chapter \ref{communication-chapter} provided grounding work to build further experiments upon, with an understanding gained of ROS' communication performance at a variety of message frequencies, and with a variety of hardware set-ups such as reduced processing power and Wi-Fi connections.

Chapter \ref{host-scalability-chapter} now aims to investigate how well a multi-robot system can scale with ROS. As mentioned in Section \ref{background-scalability}, scalability can refer to many different concepts - in this chapter scalabiltiy will be considered in terms of vertical and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling refers to running multiple identical processes on the same host machines. This has the opportunity to allow for more CPU cores to be utilised (in the case of a multi-core host), however can introduce issues if other system resources are a bottleneck (e.g. if there is not enough RAM to support the new processes, or the new processes are storage-heavy tasks causing resource contention). Horizontal scaling refers to distributing workloads across increasing numbers of host machines. This has the benefit that each host will generally have an entire set of resources (CPU, RAM, disk, GPU, etc) to itself, circumventing the issue of resource contention seen in vertical scaling. There are significant downsides to horizontal scaling though. Horizontal scaling introduces a need for complex communication between the hosts to organise and distribute tasks, or to communicate results. Horizontal scaling also has an economic impact, as it requires new hardware to be purchased and managed.
